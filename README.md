 SnapSafe : A Hate Speech Detection Model for Snapchat.

This project focuses on developing a hate speech detection model specifically for Snapchat. By analyzing a dataset from Kaggle, which contains data labeled as hate speech (1) or non-hate speech (0), we aim to train an effective machine learning model to identify and flag harmful content. The dataset's labels enable us to differentiate between hate speech and benign content, forming the foundation for our model's training and evaluation. Our goal is to enhance user safety and foster a positive online environment on Snapchat through precise and reliable hate speech detection. The trained model can then be integrated into Snapchat's content moderation system for real-time monitoring.
